# 🌐 Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio website, showcasing my skills, achievements, and projects as a budding backend and full-stack developer.

---

## 🎨 Frontend

- **HTML5**: Structured sections including Home, Services, Portfolio, and Contact for seamless navigation.
- **CSS3**: Modern and responsive design with animations, a dark theme, and vibrant accent colors for an engaging user experience.
- **JavaScript**:
  - Smooth scrolling and active navigation highlighting based on scroll position.
  - Dynamic text animations using `Typed.js` for roles like "Frontend Developer", "Java Developer", and "Database Administrator".
  - Scroll animations powered by `ScrollReveal`.

## ⚙️ Backend

- **Node.js**: Handles server-side logic and form submission.
- **Express.js**: Framework for routing and middleware setup.
- **MySQL**: Integration using `mysql2` and connection pooling for storing contact form data in a structured table.

## ✉️ Contact Form

- Real-time input validation.
- Form data stored securely in a MySQL database through backend integration.
